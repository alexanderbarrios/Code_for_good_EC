# Code for _Good elliptic curves with a specified torsion subgroup_

This repository contains the code that verifies some of the results of the paper _Good elliptic curves with a specified torsion subgroup_ by Alexander Barrios. The codes are written by the author as well.

This code was written on Mathematica and SageMath, and the repository consists of 7 files:

(1) definitions.sage

(2) Verification_of_Proposition_3_1.ipynb

(3) Verification_of_Lemma_3_2.ipynb

(4) Verification_of_Lemma_4_1.ipynb

(5) Verification_of_Lemmas.nb

(6) Verification_of_Lemmas.pdf

(7) Qualities_and_MSRs.ipynb

File (1) contains the definitions that are called by (2), (3), (4), and (7).

File (2) verifies Proposition 3.1.

File (3) verifies Lemma 3.2.

File (4) verifies Lemma 4.1.

File (5) and (6) verifies Lemmas 4.2, 4.3, and 6.1. We note that (6) is a pdf of the mathematica notebook (5).

File (7) verifies the approximations given in tables (4.2), (4.3), (4.5), as well as the table before the statement of Lemma 5.2.
